# 🥛 PakMilk - Pakistan's First Online Fresh Milk & Dairy Marketplace

**Revolutionizing the way Pakistan buys fresh dairy products**

## 🌟 The Vision

In a country where 220+ million people consume dairy daily, there's a surprising gap in the digital marketplace for fresh milk and dairy products. While e-commerce platforms exist for packaged goods, **fresh, open milk delivery remains largely traditional and unorganized**.

**PakMilk introduces Pakistan's first dedicated online platform** for fresh dairy products, bridging the gap between local dairy farmers and urban consumers who seek quality, convenience, and transparency in their daily milk supply.
